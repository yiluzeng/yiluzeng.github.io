        <ul>
            <li>Developed "Weenix," a Unix-like operating system with features including VFS (Virtual File System) and S5FS (System V File System).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li><a href="https://github.com/yiluzeng/Mthreads">Mthreads</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented a library with an M-to-N (M user-level threads multiplexed on N kernel threads) threading model; 
                complete with thread creation/deletion/joining, mutexes, condition variables, and a priority-based scheduler.</li>
            <li>Support user-level threads running in parallel on many processors and can use the implemented package to write multi-threaded applications.</li>
        </ul>   
        
        <li><a href="https://github.com/yiluzeng/Database">Database</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a server to manage a store item database of key-value pairs over a network; implemented multi-threaded functionality to handle multiple 
                clients and signal handlings reacting to user inputs in C.</li>
            <li>Provided thread-safe infrastructure for users to search for items in the database, add new entries, 
                and remove existing entries.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/yiluzeng/Shell">Shell</a></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a version of C Shell; did text parsing on input and took appropriate built-in and external actions.</li>
            <li>Implemented a job control that was able to handle multiple processes by running some in the background, as well as managing processes with signal forwarding.</li>
        </ul>

    </ul>
